# Rock-Paper-Scissors

### Project Description
This is the third project in the foundations course (JavaScript section) of the Odin project curriculum. The project is a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Learned Skills
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- DOM (Document Object Model)

### Functionality
The game allows the user to play Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The user can choose their move by clicking on one of the three buttons (Rock, Paper, or Scissors). The computer's move is randomly generated. The result of each round is displayed, and the scores are updated accordingly.

The game continues until either the user or the computer reaches a score of 5. At this point, the game winner is announced, and the game is automatically restarted after a short delay.

### Features
- User-friendly interface with buttons for selecting moves
- Random computer move generation
- Round result display
- Score tracking for both the user and the computer
- Game winner announcement
- Automatic game restart after a winner is determined

### Implementation Details
- The project uses HTML for the structure and layout of the game interface.
- CSS is used for styling the game elements and creating an appealing visual design.
- JavaScript is used for implementing the game logic, handling user interactions, updating the DOM, and managing the game flow.
- The DOM is manipulated using JavaScript to update the displayed information (computer's move, result, scores, and game winner).

### How to Run
1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. The game interface will be displayed, and you can start playing by clicking on the Rock, Paper, or Scissors buttons.
